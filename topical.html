            <p>Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea and underground cables. Despite the global nature of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical cables makes its flow of information sometimes subject to national borders. One recent example of this is the new Norwegian E-Law (2020), which propose that the intelligence service can monitor and collect all data that goes across the national border. 

                As society becomes increasingly digitalized, internet cables can also be seen as critical infrastructure. Internet cables, both in the North-Sea and of the coast of Taiwan is suspected to have been deliberately sabotaged.
                
                An estimated 2,5 billion people in the world do not yet have access to the internet. To overcome the physical limitations of internet cables, companies like Starlink and the EU are working on providing internet access through satellites. Elon Muskâ€™s Starlink is today the largest global provider of satellite internet with over 4,500 satellites in orbit. They expect to have 42,000 new ones in orbit in the coming years.
