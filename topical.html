            <h1>Overcoming the limitations of cabels</h1>
            <p>
                Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergrounding">underground cables</a>. Despite the global nature
                of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical
                cables makes its flow of information sometimes subject to national borders. One recent example of this
                is the new Norwegian E-Law,<sup><a href="#link10">[10]</a></sup> which
                propose that the intelligence service can monitor and collect
                all data that goes across the national border. As society becomes increasingly digitalized, internet
                cables can also be seen as critical infrastructure. Internet cables, both in the North-Sea and of the
                coast of Taiwan is suspected to have been deliberately sabotaged. An
                estimated 2,5 billion people in the world do not yet have access to the internet.<sup><a href="#link11">[11]</a></sup> To overcome the physical limitations of internet cables,
                companies like Starlink and the EU are working on providing internet access through satellites. Elon
                Musks Starlink is today the largest global provider of satellite internet with over 4,500 satellites in
                orbit. They expect to have 42,000 new ones in orbit in the coming years.<sup><a href="#link12">[12]</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>Imagine that you are part of a group of experts in computer technology that have been given the task of
                exploring what the potential impact of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access">satellite internet</a> technology
                might have on society.
                Your discussions can include its effects on national security, privacy, and everyday life.
                You could also discuss how the internet compares to other critical infrastructure like the electrical
                power grid, the sewage system or public roads.
                Include external sources when necessary. How is the internet connected to other infrastructures?</p>
            <h2>Creating opportunities</h2>
            <p>Connectivity to areas of the world with no internet gives a lot of new opportunities, such as access to
                educational resources, and develop academic skills thats needed to get work opportunities.<sup><a href="#link2">[2]</a></sup> 
                Security and availability. Especially when natural or non-natural disasters occurs. This was for example
                demonstrated during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine">Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>, 
                where Starlink ensured Ukraine free internet.<sup><a href="#link1">[1]</a></sup>
                Infrastructures have a positive effect on economic growth and provide the opportunity to develop the
                economy by providing jobs and promote the exchange of goods and services.<sup><a href="#link5">[5]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <h3>Expensive</h3>
            <p>A negative aspect of satellite internet is that it is relatively expensive compared to broadband
                internet, which will make it less accessible <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>.
                Satellite internet technology can also have delay times and slower speeds compared to broadband
                internet. This is because of the distance between the satellite and your satellite dish. The people who
                will notice this the most are those who play video games <sup><a href="#link3">[3]</a></sup>.
                There’s also the question if this infrastructure is sustainable long term because of collisions with
                space debris and new satellites. It’s estimated by 2028 that Starlink satellites will have to manoeuvre
                a million times per half-year to reduce the risk of orbital collisions.<sup><a href="#link6">[6]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>In theory this will make society better. As the exchange of information and knowledge is more available
                for everyone.
                Rural and undeveloped areas will get all the benefits and opportunities the internet can give. However,
                we also believe there will be challenges with the use of this new infrastructure.
                In 1.3, Hanne mentions how infrastructure can change and affect out physical environment.
                With Starlink the management of our orbital space will be questioned as more and more satellites
                increase the risk for orbital collisions. Yet <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a>
                is not the only player.
                “Other players all over the world, including Amazon with its project Kuiper and China with Guowang, are
                scrambling to secure orbital slots with their respective regulators”.<sup><a href="#link6">[6]</a></sup> 
                Example of non-physical changes to rural and undeveloped areas are the access to educational and
                economic resources, new work, and therefore hopefully economic growth. However, in this case it’s also
                dependent on the vision and values of <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a>.
                What’s the intended purpose with Starlink? Are these intentions transparent to the public? Given the
                cost of launching these satellites, will poor people who might benefit the most, get access to this
                infrastructure?
            </p>
            <h3>Radiation</h3>
            <p>An example of an unintended consequence is radiation from the satellites that can accumulate and
                interfere with other kinds of radio telescopes. Since Starlink is set to grow to 12000 satellites, from
                the now 4000, there is bound to be more interference. However, Starlink is now working with scientist to
                identify and isolate the issues.<sup><a href="#link9">[9]</a></sup> 
                Some people may lose their jobs like cable and internet services because of the new technology. This
                will also make people less active. Radioactive waves can be harmful to our health and ultimately nature
                can be damaged.
                Satellite internet can lead to less disturbance in the environment considering that there is no need for
                large cables or wires to be laid on the ground. However, satellite internet can still cause negative
                consequences. The satellites that are placed in orbit around the world can contribute to space debris.
                The satellites that have a malfunction or reach the end of their life remain in orbit as debris or they
                can damage other satellites or spacecraft.<sup><a href="#link4">[4]</a></sup> 
                With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access">satellite internet</a>, people
                will more easily get in touch with family and friends around the world
                in rural or undeveloped areas. It can lead to a more globalized culture with new ideas and perspectives
                from other countries. It connects people, businesses and organizations worldwide, which can lead to
                cultural exchange and collaboration.
                There may also be economic consequences since the satellite are more expensive than the traditional
                cabled internet.<sup><a href="#link3">[3]</a></sup> Therefore, private companies may want to take a
                higher fee for
                using their platform, and then the availability will be limited again only to the wealthier of the
                population. Because of this the people that will benefit from this technology might be limited to the
                wealthy or corporations that use it for work related matters.
