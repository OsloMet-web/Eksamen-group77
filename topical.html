                Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea and
                underground cables. Despite the global nature of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical
                cables makes its flow of information sometimes subject to national borders. One recent example of this
                is the new Norwegian E-Laßw (2020), which propose that the intelligence service can monitor and collect
                all data that goes across the national border. As society becomes increasingly digitalized, internet
                cables can also be seen as critical infrastructure. Internet cables, both in the North-Sea and of the
                coast of Taiwan is suspected to have been deliberately sabotaged. An estimated 2,5 billion people in the
                world do not yet have access to the internet. To overcome the physical limitations of internet cables,
                companies like Starlink and the EU are working on providing internet access through satellites. Elon
                Musks Starlink is today the largest global provider of satellite internet with over 4,500 satellites in
                orbit. They expect to have 42,000 new ones in orbit in the coming years.
            </p>

            <p>Imagine that you are part of a group of experts in computer technology that have been given the task of
                exploring what the potential impact of satellite internet technology might have on society. Your
                discussions can include its effects on national security, privacy, and everyday life. You could also
                discuss how the internet compares to other critical infrastructure like the electrical power grid, the
                sewage system or public roads. Include external sources when necessary. How is the internet connected to
                other infrastructures?</p>

            <p>Connectivity to areas of the world with no internet gives a lot of new opportunities, such as access to
                educational resources, and develop academic skills thats needed to get work opportunities. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-strikes-deal-with-space-x-to-receive-over-10000-more-starlink-antennas-143245809.html">(Frąckiewicz, June 2023)</a> Security and availability. Especially when natural or non-natural disasters occurs. This was
                for example demonstrated during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where Starlink ensured Ukraine free
                internet <a href="https://ts2.space/nn/bruken-av-satellitt-internett-for-mal-for-baerekraftig-utvikling/">(Dent, 2022)</a>. Infrastructures have a positive effect on economic growth and provide the
                opportunity to develop the economy by providing jobs and promote the exchange of goods and services. <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-infrastructure">(MasterClass,2022)</a>
                </p>
            <p>A negative aspect of satellite internet is that it is relatively expensive compared to broadband
                internet, which will make it less accessible (Frąckiewicz, July 2023). Satellite internet technology can
                also have delay times and slower speeds compared to broadband internet. This is because of the distance
                between the satellite and your satellite dish. The people who will notice this the most are those who
                play video games <a href="https://ts2.space/nn/fordeler-og-ulemper-med-satellitt-internett-er-det-riktig-for-deg/">(Frąckiewicz,2023, July)</a>. There’s also the question if this infrastructure is
                sustainable long term because of collisions with space debris and new satellites. It’s estimated by 2028
                that Starlink satellites will have to manoeuvre a million times per half-year to reduce the risk of
                orbital collisions <a href="https://www.space.com/starlink-satellite-conjunction-increase-threatens-space-sustainability">(Pultarova,2023)</a>.</p>
            <p>In theory this will make society better. As the exchange of information and knowledge is more available
                for everyone. Rural and undeveloped areas will get all the benefits and opportunities the internet can
                give. However, we also believe there will be challenges with the use of this new infrastructure. In 1.3,
                Hanne mentions how infrastructure can change and affect out physical environment. With Starlink the
                management of our orbital space will be questioned as more and more satellites increase the risk for
                orbital collisions. Yet SpaceX is not the only player. “Other players all over the world, including
                Amazon with its project Kuiper and China with Guowang, are scrambling to secure orbital slots with their
                respective regulators” <a href="https://www.space.com/starlink-satellite-conjunction-increase-threatens-space-sustainability">(Pultarova,2023)</a>. Example of non-physical changes to rural and undeveloped areas
                are the access to educational and economic resources, new work, and therefore hopefully economic growth.
                However, in this case it’s also dependent on the vision and values of SpaceX. What’s the intended
                purpose with Starlink? Are these intentions transparent to the public? Given the cost of launching these
                satellites, will poor people who might benefit the most, get access to this infrastructure?</p>
            <p>An example of an unintended consequence is radiation from the satellites that can accumulate and
                interfere with other kinds of radio telescopes. Since Starlink is set to grow to 12000 satellites, from
                the now 4000, there is bound to be more interference. However, Starlink is now working with scientist to
                identify and isolate the issues <a href="https://circleid.com/posts/20230727-unintended-consequences-of-satellite-constellations">(Dawson,2023)</a> . Some people may lose their jobs like cable and internet
                services because of the new technology. This will also make people less active. Radioactive waves can be
                harmful to our health and ultimately nature can be damaged. Satellite internet can lead to less
                disturbance in the environment considering that there is no need for large cables or wires to be laid on
                the ground. However, satellite internet can still cause negative consequences. The satellites that are
                placed in orbit around the world can contribute to space debris. The satellites that have a malfunction
                or reach the end of their life remain in orbit as debris or they can damage other satellites or
                spacecraft <a href="https://ts2.space/en/the-environmental-impact-of-satellite-internet-a-closer-look/ ">(Frąckiewicz, March 2023)</a>. With satellite internet, people will more easily get in touch with
                family and friends around the world in rural or undeveloped areas. It can lead to a more globalized
                culture with new ideas and perspectives from other countries. It connects people, businesses and
                organizations worldwide, which can lead to cultural exchange and collaboration. There may also be
                economic consequences since the satellite are more expensive than the traditional cabled internet <a href="https://ts2.space/nn/fordeler-og-ulemper-med-satellitt-internett-er-det-riktig-for-deg/">(Frąckiewicz,2023, July)</a>
                . Therefore, private companies may want to take a higher fee for using their
                platform, and then the availability will be limited again only to the wealthier of the population.
                Because of this the people that will benefit from this technology might be limited to the wealthy or
                corporations that use it for work related matters.</p>
